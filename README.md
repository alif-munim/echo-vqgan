## Echo ViT-VQGAN
Echocardiogram quality enhancement using ViT-VQGANs, introduced in the paper [Vector-quantized Image Modeling with Improved VQGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04627). Heavily inspired by the repositories [Qiyuan-Ge/PaintMind](https://github.com/Qiyuan-Ge/PaintMind) and [CompVis/taming-transformers](https://github.com/CompVis/taming-transformers).

### Notes
- To run inference on a pretrained model, `cd` into the `scripts` directory and run `inference.py`.
- To train a model from scratch, `cd` into the `scripts` directory and run `train.py`.
